## Odinbook

Odinbook is an application created as part of the final assignment for the Odin Project. The basic idea behind the app was to mimic Facebook and its key features. The features include logging into the site (using Passport JS, specifically its Facebook authentication), creating posts, liking posts, viewing friend posts, and sending and receiving friends requests. Users profile images are pulled from their Facebook account however, users can update their profile image on Odinbook if they would like.

Guest functionality was implemented so that people who don't want to sign in can still view the app.
